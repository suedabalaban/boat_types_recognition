## Boat Types Recognition

Custom object detection model built using YOLOv8 deep learning framework and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kunalgupta2616/boat-types-recognition dataset.


## Features
- The training model is able to distinguish between 9 different boat types: 
buoy | cruise ship | ferry boat |  freight boat |   gondola | inflatable boat | kayak | paper boat | sailboat
- The model enables live object detection
- The script outputs bounding boxes and class labels for each detected boats
- The script saves the results to output.mp4 when object detection is completed
